Data GUI Application - README
This program allows you to insert, manage, and calculate results based on tabular data.
You can manually enter values or import them from external files (Excel or CSV). After that, you can run calculations using a pre-trained model.



MAIN FEATURES
Add and edit data in a table.
Import and export datasets (Excel or CSV).
Run calculations on selected rows.
Clean and correct invalid inputs.



BUTTONS DESCRIPTION

	Add – Adds a new row using the values in the input fields.

	Copy – Copies the selected row into the input fields.

	Edit – Replaces the selected rows with the values from the input fields.

	Set Defaults – Sets the current input values as default values (also used as placeholders). Defaults can also be loaded from or saved to an external file.

	Clear Inputs – Clears all the input fields.

	Clear Outputs – Clears the calculated output values in the selected rows.

	Clean – Removes invalid or non-numeric values in the selected rows. If all inputs in a row are invalid, the row is deleted.

	Correct – Same as Clean, but instead of leaving empty fields, it replaces invalid inputs with the default values.

	Select All – Selects all the rows in the table.

	Deselect All – Deselects all selected rows.

	Delete – Deletes the selected rows from the table.

	Run Calculation – Performs the calculation on the selected rows using the trained model. Note: it may take some time with large datasets.



MENU OPTIONS

	File Menu
		- Import Dataset – Loads a correctly formatted dataset (CSV or Excel).

		- Export Dataset
			- All Data – exports all rows and all columns.
			- Only Inputs – exports all rows, but only the input columns (no output results).

		- Export Selected
			- All Data – exports only the selected rows, including results.
			- Only Inputs – exports only the input fields of selected rows.

		- Print Example – Creates an example dataset in the same folder as the program (CSV or Excel).

		- Exit – Closes the program (with confirmation prompt).

	Help Menu
		- Open README – Opens this instruction file.



INPUT FIELDS
Each dataset row consists of a fixed set of input fields plus an optional threshold.
Each input field has a default value (used as placeholder) that can be customized.

	A – numeric value

	B – numeric value

	C – numeric value

	...

	L – numeric value



OPTIONAL INPUT FIELD
If filled, the program will compare the calculated result to this threshold and indicate whether it is above or below.
If not filled, this check is skipped.

	Threshold – numeric value




OUTPUT COLUMNS

	output – The calculated result for the row, generated by the model after clicking Run Calculation.

	output_flag – A simple indicator that compares the output value to the threshold (if provided).
	If the threshold is filled, this will show whether the result is above or below the indicated value.
	If no threshold is provided, this column will remain empty.



OTHER INFORMATION
All input values must be numeric (decimal numbers) unless specified otherwise.
Invalid entries can be automatically cleaned or corrected using the Clean or Correct buttons.
Exported files can be opened in Excel or other spreadsheet software.
Calculations for large datasets may take a few minutes.
The program works without internet connection.



HOW TO USE
Start the program.
Insert data in the input fields.
Click Add to add the data to the table.
Select one or more rows.
Click Run Calculation to compute results.
Export the results if needed.
